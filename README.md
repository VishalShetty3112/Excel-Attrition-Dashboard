# Problems to be overcome
* High Attrition in Early Tenure (0‚Äì1 Years at Company): Strengthening onboarding and mentoring programs, clear communication of job roles and growth paths, providing early performance feedback and support.
*  High Attrition in Low Salary Slabs (Below ‚Çπ5K) : Revisiting compensation structure and ensuring market competitiveness.
Offering performance-based incentives and bonuses, upskilling programs to help employees move to higher-paying roles.
*  High Attrition in Certain Roles (e.g., Sales Executive, Lab Technician): Role rotation or job enrichment to reduce monotony, introducing career development plans or certifications, regular workload analysis and well-being check-ins.
* Low Job Satisfaction Ratings (1 & 2 Rating Employees Leaving): Conducting anonymous feedback and pulse surveys, manager training programs on empathy, communication, and leadership, recognition and reward systems.
Problems That Are Harder to Control (But Still Manageable)
* 	Age-Group Related Attrition (e.g., 26‚Äì35 age group): This group is naturally more mobile in career stages. Still, career growth paths, reskilling, and leadership tracks can help retain them.
* Attrition by Education Field: Some fields may have industry-wide demand (e.g., Life Sciences), causing external pull. Offering learning, patents, or research grants can increase loyalty.

# Conclusion
Salary and job satisfaction are the major drivers of attrition. Special attention is needed for early tenure employees, especially those in R&D and Sales departments. HR should focus on: Improving onboarding processes, addressing pay disparities, creating growth opportunities for high-attrition roles, regular satisfaction surveys and feedback loops. Gender attrition appears stable and balanced.
